# GT Image Placeholders

This little JS library prevents images from pushing content down as they load into a page in GuidedTrack programs.

To use it, simply download the JS file and drop it into an HTML page in a script tag:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...

    <script src="path/to/gt-image-placeholders.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
